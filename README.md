# hubot-filesearch
Hubot and Bash scripts to search local files on Linux Server and give users chatops access to data.

My department uses Slack to communicate and a Linux Server I built to share files. There's terabytes of data and lots of it is hard to find, so with Hubot I created a search function simple enough all my users can use to see the paths of their files.

Used in tandem with a copy and a post function, they basically have access to everything I do without learning Bash commands nor opening up any extraneous shell users.
